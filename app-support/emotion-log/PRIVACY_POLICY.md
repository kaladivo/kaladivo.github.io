# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 2025**

## Introduction

Emotions Log ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Summary

**We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.** All your mood entries, notes, and settings are stored locally on your device and never leave it.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not collect mood entries or notes
- We do not collect usage analytics
- We do not collect device identifiers
- We do not use tracking technologies
- We do not use cookies

## Data Storage

All data created within Emotions Log is stored locally on your device using secure on-device storage. This includes:

- Mood entries (mood ratings, timestamps, reasons, notes)
- Custom reasons you create
- Notification schedules and preferences
- App settings

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it using the app's export feature.

## Data Export

The app provides an export feature that allows you to save your data as a JSON file. When you use this feature:

- The exported file is saved to your device
- You control what happens to this file
- We have no access to exported files

## Third-Party Services

Emotions Log does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Notifications

If you enable notifications, they are scheduled and delivered entirely through your device's operating system. We do not use push notification services that would require sending data to external servers.

## Children's Privacy

Emotions Log does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and stores all data locally.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security settings. We recommend:

- Using a device passcode or biometric lock
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Being cautious about who has physical access to your device

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there is nothing for us to delete, modify, or provide to you. You have complete control over your data:

- **Delete**: Uninstalling the app removes all data
- **Export**: Use the in-app export feature to backup your data
- **Modify**: Edit or delete entries directly within the app

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Compliance

This privacy policy is designed to comply with:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Apple App Store Guidelines
- Google Play Store Requirements

Since we do not collect any personal data, most data protection regulations' requirements regarding data collection, processing, and sharing do not apply to our app.
